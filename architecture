# Technical Architecture & Design Rationale

## 🏗️ Network Design Rationale
For this project, I implemented a **Multi-Availability Zone (Multi-AZ)** architecture using `us-east-1a` and `us-east-1b`. 

* **High Availability**: By distributing subnets across two distinct physical data centers, the application remains resilient against a single-point failure at the Availability Zone level.
* **Scalable CIDR Strategy**: I chose a `/16` VPC CIDR (`10.0.0.0/16`) to provide a large address space, which I then segmented into `/24` subnets (256 IP addresses each). This provides a balance between having enough addresses for horizontal scaling and maintaining clear logical separation for management.

## 🔒 Security Strategy: The "Vault" Approach
The security of this architecture is built on the principle of **Least Privilege** and **Network Isolation**.

### 1. Tier Isolation
* **Public Tier**: Contains the Application Load Balancer (ALB). It is the only tier with a route to the Internet Gateway.
* **Application Tier**: Instances are placed in private subnets with no direct route to the internet. They are designed to receive traffic only from the ALB once Security Groups are finalized.
* **Database Tier**: This is the most restricted layer. It is isolated in private subnets with no internet gateway access and is only reachable by the application tier.

### 2. Routing Logic
* **Public Route Table**: Explicitly associated with `public-1a` and `public-1b`, routing `0.0.0.0/0` traffic to the **Internet Gateway**.
* **Private Route Table**: Used by the App and DB tiers. It only contains a "Local" route, ensuring that no traffic can enter or leave these subnets without passing through a security checkpoint (like a Load Balancer or NAT Gateway).

## 🚦 Traffic Flow
1. **User Request**: Enters through the Internet Gateway.
2. **ALB**: Receives traffic in the public tier and prepares to forward it to the App Tier.
3. **Application**: Processes the request and queries the Database Tier.
4. **Database**: Returns data to the App Tier over a secure, internal connection.
