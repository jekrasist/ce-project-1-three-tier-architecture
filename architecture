# Technical Architecture & Design Rationale

## 🏗️ Network Design Rationale
For this project, I implemented a **Multi-Availability Zone (Multi-AZ)** architecture using `us-east-1a` and `us-east-1b`. 

* **High Availability**: Distributing subnets across two AZs ensures the app stays up if one data center goes down.
* **Scalable CIDR Strategy**: I used a `10.0.0.0/16` VPC CIDR to allow for massive horizontal scaling.

## 🔒 Security Strategy
The security is built on **Network Isolation**.

* **Public Tier**: Only the ALB is internet-facing via the Internet Gateway.
* **Private App Tier**: Isolated from the internet; only accessible via the Web Tier.
* **Private DB Tier**: No internet route; only accessible via the App Tier.
